# Alpha Hunter: Path to $100K/Month Revenue

**Date:** 2026-02-27

---

## TL;DR

Personal betting alone can't reach $100K/month (you'd need a $2.5M bankroll and sportsbooks will limit you). The realistic path is a **hybrid**: subscriptions + content + affiliates + a small betting club. Timeline: 18-24 months.

---

## Path 1: Personal Betting
- **Math:** 350 signals/month × $2.30 avg profit = ~$805/month on $20K bankroll
- **To hit $100K:** Need $2.5M bankroll at half-Kelly
- **Reality:** Sportsbooks limit winning accounts within 2-4 weeks
- **Verdict:** Use as proof-of-concept, not primary revenue. Realistic: $2-5K/month

## Path 2: Subscription SaaS ⭐ PRIMARY PATH
- **Pricing:** $49 basic / $149 pro / $499 sharp per month
- **Target:** ~400 Pro-tier subscribers = $100K MRR
- **Requirements:**
  - Deploy dashboard with auth + payments (Clerk + Stripe)
  - Telegram bot for real-time alerts (critical — betting community lives there)
  - Verified track record on Betstamp (non-negotiable for trust)
  - Discord community for retention
- **Timeline:** 18-24 months to $100K MRR
- **Customer acquisition:** 10,000 engaged followers → 400 paying (4% conversion)

## Path 3: Betting Club / Syndicate
- **Model:** 20-40 high-net-worth bettors at $2,500/month each
- **Legal:** Selling information (not managing money) is simpler
- **Requires:** 12+ months verified track record first
- **Timeline:** 24-36 months

## Path 4: B2B Licensing
- **Buyers:** Institutional bettors, media companies
- **Pricing:** $10-50K/month per client
- **Reality:** Long sales cycles, small addressable market
- **Verdict:** Supplementary revenue stream after Year 1

## Path 5: Content & Affiliates
- **Sportsbook affiliates:** $200-400 per referral, $10-30K/month at scale
- **YouTube + Twitter:** Build audience showing live signals + transparent results
- **Key insight:** Technical builder showing code + math is a gap in the market
- **Verdict:** Force multiplier for Path 2, not standalone

## What Could Kill This
1. Edge disappears as books get smarter
2. Can't market (most technical founders' weakness)
3. Subscriber churn during losing streaks (5% edge = 47% loss rate)
4. Burnout (sole developer + marketer + analyst)

## Do Today
1. Create Betstamp account — start verified track record
2. Create Twitter/X account — post first signal tonight
3. Post the result tomorrow morning
4. Do this every single day
